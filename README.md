# Hacktoberfest Platformer ðŸŽ® ðŸŽƒ

Let's build a platformer game for hacktoberfest!

I'm starting this project late, but there's still 20 days left, we can do it!

I have added a bunch of random code to start things off and see if there is any interest.

The idea of the game (so far) is to collect pull request icons and kill bugs. I'm guessing we should have a timer on the game and 4 pull requests need to be found / collected before it runs out? Open to suggestions, this is just a bit of fun.

This project is using [Phaser 3](https://www.phaser.io/phaser3) Javascript game framework.

Project template forked from ['Phaser 3 project template'](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template).

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command         | Description                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`   | Install project dependencies                                                    |
| `npm start`     | Build project and open web server running project                               |
| `npm run build` | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder
and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:8080`
by default).
